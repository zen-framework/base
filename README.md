# Zen Framework Base

The base scaffold for creating new Zen Framework designs.

## Introduction
The Zen Framework is an opinionated templating framework designed to create a consistent structure with a flexible and efficient styling strategy. Greatly inspired by the CSS Zen Garden.

The HTML remains the same - all that changes between designs is the CSS (along with JS and images, as needed). With a strict, community decided set of HTML structures the Zen Framework allows you to focus on creating beautiful CSS.

## Getting Started
The Zen Framework is still in the early stages of development so, it's not quite ready for production yet. However, if you would like to contribute to the development, we could really use your input!

If you'd like to work on a design, clone down this repo and open the index.html file in your browser. Load the project folder into your favorite code editor and open up the main.css file in the assets/css directory and start designing!

Once you have finished, you can simply rename your assets folder to a unique name that you would like to give your design and it is ready to be shared or implemented!

## What If I Want Use It In My CMS?
We recognize that every CMS has different processes and requirements when creating templates. So, we distanced ourselves from focusing on any specific one. Instead - we tried to make the development process as simple as possible to benefit both the back-end implementation as well as the front-end design process. 

Since all of the designs in the Zen Framework are powered by a single CSS file all that is really needed to implement the Zen Framework into your CMS is to use the HTML modules that are defined in the base HTML file.

In the future our goal is to make the HTML module information far more documented and accessible to make the process of implementing it into various CMS's as easy as posible.

## Modules
Each website is made up of reusable blocks that we call modules. Each of these is included in the HTML file provided in this repo.
